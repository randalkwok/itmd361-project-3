          <h3>How did you get into magic?</h3>
          <p>
              Since I was little, I was always interested in magic. Whether it was watching David Blaine on TV or trying 
              to learn simple card tricks on YouTube, I found it fascinating. However, I never really got into magic seriously 
              until the beginning of 2017 when I showed my family a simple card trick I learned on YouTube. Their reaction 
              and just the fun we had made me want to just learn more and more. I have not skipped a day without 
              practicing and learning since.

          <h3>Why are you interested in magic?</h3>
          <p>
            I don't do magic because I want to fool people. I see magic as a way to connect to people and bring joy to 
            their day. Magic allows me to for just a few moments show people what shouldn't be possible. When we 
            were kids, the smallest things would blow our minds. Everything new was amazing. That's the feeling I 
            want people to feel again. That's why I love magic so much.

            I mainly do close up card magic.
