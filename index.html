          <h3>Who are you?</h3>
            <p>
              Hello, I'm Randal Kwok and I'm currently a 4th year student at Illinois Institute of Technology pursuing my 
              Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science. I was born and raised in Chicago, IL. Besides video games, 
              music, movies, and other forms of entertainment that I enjoy, one of my main hobbies is magic. You can 
              check out my resume as well as learn about my hobby here on this site.
            </p>
          <h3>Why computer science?</h3>
            <p>
              Computer programming really excites me. I’ve grown up during the time computers are rapidly 
              occupying our world. I’ve always wondered how they work and that’s why I took a computer science 
              class in high school. In this class, I learned programming isn’t just 1’s and 0’s, but a completely new way of 
              thinking and solving problems. Just like you need different mindsets to solve either math or science problems, 
              you need a new mindset to solve computer science problems and that’s what excites me.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s a mixture of analyzing the problem, assessing the tools you have, and staying organized. Being able 
              to complete a computational problem is more satisfying than any other math or science problem. It 
              made me realize just how complex some software is. I look at computers differently in that I always 
              wonder how a certain program might work.
